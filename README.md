<h3 align="left">
I am a manual tester learning test automation in Python. I constantly study new technologies, methods and tools 
related to testing in order to keep abreast of the latest trends and apply them in practical work. I actively 
participate in online courses, reading professional books and forums where I can learn from experienced professionals. 
I also look forward to participating in professional conferences and meetups to share knowledge and connect with 
colleagues from the testing industry. All this helps me not only develop as a test automator, but also bring great 
value to the team and achieve high results.
